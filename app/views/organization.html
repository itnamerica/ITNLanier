                <p>It connects every ITN affiliate community into one effective centralized national network that manages the logistics of the senior transportation service, including member and volunteer management and ride scheduling.</p>

                <p>All ITN affiliates access the software through an internet connection and store their information at our secure data center. The collected data is used for a variety of purposes; including helping social researchers better understand senior mobility and its effects on society. ITN technology provides everything needed to deliver logistical efficiency to a very complex problem.</p>

                <p>ITN is quickly linking cities and citizens across the country and that's just the beginning. Soon, ITN will grow beyond the cities and suburbs to the small towns and rural communities where the unmet need is so great.
